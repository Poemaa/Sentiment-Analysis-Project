# Student Feedback Sentiment Analysis App

This Student Feedback Analysis App is one of the projects that I had to do in my last year of univerisity for a "Software Design" class.
It is mainly an app for student feedback analysis, mostly dedicated to students and colleges in my homecountry,  however it can be adapted to various
other uses that deal with the same theme too. The Student Feedback Analysis App is designed to help students share their college experiences, compare 
different colleges and make informed decisions. 

This project is built with a .NET application and MSSQL database, that provides a platform for students to interact, exchange feedback, and learn more 
about different colleges where they can pursue further education. 
Additionally, it incorporates a Python script for sentiment analysis, classifying feedbacks from users as positive, negative, or neutral.

While this project is not fully finished since we were still had a lot more to learn about the Python part, it has great potential to become 
a fully functional feedback platform with further development.
